## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- enter plan mode before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- compile/render and confirm output at the end of every task
- **Single source of truth** -- Beamer `.tex` is authoritative; Quarto `.qmd` derives from it
- **Quality gates** -- nothing ships below 80/100
- **[LEARN] tags** -- when corrected, save `[LEARN:category] wrong → right` to [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md)

Cross-session context lives in [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md); past plans, specs, and session logs are in [quality_reports/](quality_reports/).

## Commands

```bash
# LaTeX (3-pass, XeLaTeX only)
cd Slides && TEXINPUTS=../Preambles:$TEXINPUTS xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode file.tex
BIBINPUTS=..:$BIBINPUTS bibtex file
TEXINPUTS=../Preambles:$TEXINPUTS xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode file.tex
TEXINPUTS=../Preambles:$TEXINPUTS xelatex -interaction=nonstopmode file.tex

# Deploy Quarto to GitHub Pages
./scripts/sync_to_docs.sh LectureN

# Quality score
python scripts/quality_score.py Quarto/file.qmd

# Palette sync (LaTeX ↔ SCSS)
./scripts/check-palette-sync.sh

# Surface-count sync (README ↔ CLAUDE.md ↔ guide ↔ landing page)
./scripts/check-surface-sync.sh
```

**Palette contract:** color names in `Preambles/header.tex` must match SCSS variables in `Quarto/theme-template.scss`. See [`Preambles/README.md`](Preambles/README.md).

## Quality Thresholds (advisory)

| Score | Checkpoint | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| 80 | Commit | Good enough to save |
| 90 | PR | Ready for deployment |
| 95 | Excellence | Aspirational |

Enforced by `/commit` (halts + asks for override); not enforced by a git pre-commit hook.
