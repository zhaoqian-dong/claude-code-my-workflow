> **Actively maintained.** A summary of how I use Claude Code for academic work — slides, papers, data analysis, and more — packaged so you can fork it for your own research. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the latest changes.

**Live site:** [psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/)

A ready-to-fork foundation for AI-assisted academic work. You describe what you want — lecture slides, a research paper, a data analysis, a replication package — and Claude plans the approach, runs specialized agents, fixes issues, verifies quality, and presents results. Like a contractor who handles the entire job. Extracted from a production PhD course and extended by a growing [community](#community--extensions).

---

## Quick Start (5–10 minutes, plus ~30 min for first-time installs)

> **Before you start:** Claude Code + git are the minimum. To run the included `HelloWorld` demos end-to-end you also need XeLaTeX (Beamer sample) and Quarto (Quarto sample). R and the GitHub CLI are recommended. Python 3 is used by a few internal scripts (`check-palette-sync.py`, `check-tikz-prevention.py`) and is pre-installed on macOS/Linux. Full list in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) below. Fastest path: clone first, then run `./scripts/validate-setup.sh` — it reports exactly what's missing with install links.
>
> **Only need Python/R/markdown?** You don't need XeLaTeX or Quarto. The agents, rules, skills, and orchestration patterns work for any text/code artifact. Skip the `HelloWorld` demos and head straight to `/data-analysis`, `/review-paper`, `/lit-review`, or `/review-r`.
>
> **Session 2 onwards:** [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md) (committed) collects generic `[LEARN]` entries that help all forkers; `.claude/state/personal-memory.md` (gitignored) is for machine-specific notes. See [`.claude/rules/meta-governance.md`](.claude/rules/meta-governance.md) for the distinction.

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork this repo on GitHub (click "Fork" on the repo page), then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/claude-code-my-workflow.git my-project
cd my-project
./scripts/validate-setup.sh        # reports missing tools with install links
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

### 2. Start Claude Code and Paste This Prompt

```bash
claude
```

**Using VS Code?** Open the Claude Code panel instead. Everything works the same — see the [full guide](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#sec-setup) for details.

> **Avoid prompt fatigue.** Out of the box, Claude Code asks permission for every tool invocation. After the first few approvals, toggle **Auto-accept edits** mode (a keybinding; see the [permission modes section](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#settings---permissions-and-hooks) of the guide) or run `claude --permission-mode acceptEdits`. For fully-autonomous runs on a trusted repo, **Bypass** mode skips prompts entirely. The template's `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves ~100 common Bash and Edit/Write patterns, so even at default permissions most work is unattended.

Then paste the [starter prompt](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#sec-first-session) from the guide, filling in your project details:

> I am starting to work on **[PROJECT NAME]** in this repo. **[Describe your project in 2–3 sentences.]** I've set up the Claude Code academic workflow... Please read the configuration files and adapt them for my project. Enter plan mode and start.

The [full guide](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#sec-first-session) has the complete starter prompt with all the details.

**What this does:** Claude reads all the configuration files, fills in your project name, institution, and preferences, then enters contractor mode — planning, implementing, and (within the skill you invoke) running the review + verify loop. You approve the plan, invoke a skill, and the skill handles the rest within its scope.

> **Heavily adapting CLAUDE.md for a non-academic project?** Anthropic's built-in `/init` command will re-derive a `CLAUDE.md` from your codebase as a starting point. The pre-shipped CLAUDE.md in this template already covers the academic setup — you only need `/init` if your fork diverges substantially (e.g., a Python/ML project that doesn't use LaTeX or Quarto).

### 3. Verify Your Setup

Before building real lectures, confirm your environment works:

```bash
./scripts/validate-setup.sh        # Checks XeLaTeX, Quarto, Python, git, etc.
```

Then inside Claude:

```text
/compile-latex HelloWorld          # Compiles Slides/HelloWorld.tex to PDF
/deploy HelloWorld                 # Renders Quarto/HelloWorld.qmd to HTML
```

If both succeed, delete `Slides/HelloWorld.tex` and `Quarto/HelloWorld.qmd` and start on your real work.

---

## How It Works

### Contractor Mode

You describe a task. For complex or ambiguous requests, Claude first creates a requirements specification with MUST/SHOULD/MAY priorities and clarity status (CLEAR/ASSUMED/BLOCKED). You approve the spec, then Claude plans the approach and invokes the right skill (e.g. `/create-lecture`, `/qa-quarto`, `/review-paper --adversarial`). That skill implements the orchestrator pattern internally — implement, verify, review, fix, re-verify, score — and returns a summary when the work meets quality standards. Say "just do it" and it auto-commits when the score clears 80.

### Specialized Agents

Instead of one general-purpose reviewer, 14 focused agents each check one dimension. A representative sample:

- **proofreader** — grammar/typos
- **slide-auditor** — visual layout
- **pedagogy-reviewer** — teaching quality
- **r-reviewer** — R code quality
- **domain-reviewer** — field-specific correctness, slides (template — customize for your field)
- **domain-referee** / **methods-referee** / **editor** — manuscript peer-review pipeline (`/review-paper --peer`)

Each is better at its narrow task than a generalist would be. The `/slide-excellence` skill runs the slide-review agents in parallel; `/review-paper --peer` runs the paper-review pipeline. The same pattern extends to any academic artifact — manuscripts, data pipelines, proposals.

### Adversarial QA

Two agents work in opposition: the **critic** reads both Beamer and Quarto and produces harsh findings. The **fixer** implements exactly what the critic found. They loop until the critic says "APPROVED" (or 5 rounds max). This catches errors that single-pass review misses.

### Quality Review

Every artifact gets a score (0–100). Scores below threshold halt the workflow and surface the findings — the user decides whether to fix or explicitly override:

- **80** — commit threshold
- **90** — PR threshold
- **95** — excellence (aspirational)

> **Framing honesty:** Thresholds are advisory at the harness level — the `/commit` skill runs quality checks and halts on failure, but there is no pre-commit git hook that blocks a direct `git commit`. If you bypass the skill, you bypass the review. For hard enforcement, configure a git pre-commit hook.

### Context Survival

Plans, specifications, and session logs survive auto-compression and session boundaries. The PreCompact hook saves a context snapshot before Claude's auto-compression triggers, ensuring critical decisions are never lost. MEMORY.md accumulates learning across sessions, so patterns discovered in one session inform future work.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Required For | Install |
|------|-------------|---------|
| [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) | Everything | [claude.ai/install](https://claude.ai/install) |
| git | Clone + version control | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |
| Python 3 (3.9+) | Internal checkers (palette sync, TikZ prevention) | Preinstalled on macOS/Linux; [python.org](https://www.python.org/) for Windows |
| XeLaTeX | LaTeX compilation (Beamer `HelloWorld`, real lectures) | [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/) |
| [Quarto](https://quarto.org) | Web slides (Quarto `HelloWorld`, real lectures) | [quarto.org/docs/get-started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) |
| R | Figures and analysis (`/data-analysis`, `scripts/R/` template) | [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/) |
| pdf2svg | TikZ → SVG for Quarto (`/extract-tikz`) | `brew install pdf2svg` (macOS), `apt install pdf2svg` (Debian) |
| [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/) | PR / issue workflow | `brew install gh` (macOS), `apt install gh` (Debian) |

**Minimum to fork this template:** Claude Code + git + Python 3 (Python is already installed on macOS/Linux).

**Minimum to run the included HelloWorld demos end-to-end:** add XeLaTeX (for `/compile-latex HelloWorld`) and Quarto (for `/deploy HelloWorld`).

**Your real lectures may need more** — R for `scripts/R/` analyses, pdf2svg if you use TikZ extraction, gh CLI if you use the PR-based commit workflow. `./scripts/validate-setup.sh` reports which of these are installed and what each unlocks.

## Adapting for Your Field

1. **Fill in the knowledge base** (`.claude/rules/knowledge-base-template.md`) with your notation, applications, and design principles
2. **Customize the domain reviewer** (`.claude/agents/domain-reviewer.md`) with review lenses specific to your field
3. **Update the color palette** — this is a **two-surface contract**: change the HEX values at the top of **both** [`Preambles/header.tex`](Preambles/header.tex) (Beamer/TikZ) **and** [`Quarto/theme-template.scss`](Quarto/theme-template.scss) (Quarto slides) so they agree. Then run `./scripts/check-palette-sync.sh` to verify. Forgetting one surface silently produces mismatched Beamer vs. Quarto renderings. See [`Preambles/README.md`](Preambles/README.md) for the full contract and the TikZ style library.
4. **Add field-specific R pitfalls** to `.claude/rules/r-code-conventions.md`
5. **Fill in the lecture mapping** in `.claude/rules/beamer-quarto-sync.md`
6. **Customize the workflow quick reference** (`.claude/WORKFLOW_QUICK_REF.md`) with your non-negotiables and preferences
7. **Set up the exploration folder** (`explorations/`) for experimental work

## Origin

This infrastructure was extracted from **Econ 730: Causal Panel Data** at Emory University, developed by Pedro Sant'Anna using Claude Code over 6+ sessions. The course produced 6 complete PhD lecture decks with 800+ slides, interactive Quarto versions with plotly charts, and full R replication packages — all managed through this multi-agent workflow. The patterns are domain-agnostic: the same agents, rules, and orchestrator work for any academic project.

---

## Community & Extensions

As of March 2026, **15+ research groups** across economics, energy, political science, and engineering have forked and adapted this workflow. The infrastructure (orchestrator, hooks, quality gates) transfers without modification.

**Extended workflows:**
