# Troubleshooting

Top failure modes newcomers hit, with the fix. If you're stuck somewhere else, run `./scripts/validate-setup.sh` — it reports exactly what's missing.

## Environment / setup

### `claude: command not found`

Claude Code isn't installed. Install it from [claude.ai/install](https://claude.ai/install) (or your OS's package manager). Then re-run `./scripts/validate-setup.sh`.

### `xelatex: command not found`

No TeX Live on the system. Install MacTeX (macOS) or TeX Live (Linux/Windows). Until you do, `/compile-latex` and `/extract-tikz` are disabled; `/deploy` (Quarto) still works.

### `quarto: command not found`

Install Quarto from [quarto.org/docs/get-started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). Until you do, `/deploy` and `/qa-quarto` are disabled; Beamer workflows still work.

### `pdf2svg: command not found`

Required by `/extract-tikz`. `brew install pdf2svg` (macOS) / `apt install pdf2svg` (Debian/Ubuntu) / `dnf install pdf2svg` (Fedora).

### Claude keeps asking permission for every tool

Default permission mode prompts on every `Bash`, `Edit`, `Write`. Two fixes:

- **Auto-accept edits** — keybinding in Claude Code; see guide's [permission modes section](https://psantanna.com/claude-code-my-workflow/workflow-guide.html#settings---permissions-and-hooks).
- **Bypass mode** — `claude --permission-mode acceptEdits` (auto-approves edits but still prompts for sensitive ops) or `claude --permission-mode bypassPermissions` (skips prompts entirely — use only on trusted repos).

The template's `.claude/settings.json` pre-approves ~100 common patterns, so even at default most routine work is unattended.

## Compilation / rendering

### `Undefined citation` in Beamer

The `.bib` key isn't in `Bibliography_base.bib`. Run `/validate-bib` to cross-check citations against the bib file. The 3-pass XeLaTeX + bibtex sequence in `/compile-latex` resolves keys that exist; it can't invent them.

### `Overfull \hbox` warnings

Text exceeds the slide's printable width. Either shorten the offending content, wrap it in a `text width=...` node (for TikZ), or switch to `\resizebox`. `/visual-audit` flags these; `/proofread` does too.

### Quarto render fails with `No valid input files`

You likely invoked `quarto render` from the wrong cwd. Run it from the repo root. `/deploy` handles this automatically.

### HelloWorld.tex fails to compile

`./scripts/validate-setup.sh` first. If XeLaTeX is installed, re-fork a clean copy — you may have edited the sample deck without realizing it. HelloWorld is intentionally minimal and should always compile on a fresh clone.

### `/extract-tikz` halts at prevention pre-check

Good — the pre-check caught a P3 (bare `scale=`) or P4 (missing directional keyword on an edge label) violation. Fix the offending line in the Beamer source and re-run. See `.claude/rules/tikz-prevention.md`.

## Git / hooks / CI

### Hook script permission denied

`chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.py .claude/hooks/*.sh`. `./scripts/validate-setup.sh` also reports non-executable hooks.

### Pre-compact hook didn't save the plan

The PreCompact hook (`.claude/hooks/pre-compact.py`) writes state to `~/.claude/sessions/<hash>/`. If the state isn't there after compaction:

- Check the hook's exit code: `echo '{}' | python3 .claude/hooks/pre-compact.py` should exit 0.
- Check permissions on `~/.claude/sessions/`.
- Check the session hash matches — compaction logs the hash.

### `/commit` fails with `quality_score.py` below threshold

The script detected issues in changed files. Either fix them (recommended) or re-run `/commit` and explicitly tell Claude **"commit anyway"** or **"skip quality gate"** with a reason — the override is logged in the commit message. (There is no `--skip-quality-gate` CLI flag; the override is a natural-language signal to the skill.)

## Palette / theming

### Beamer and Quarto renderings use different colors

The palette contract broke. Run `./scripts/check-palette-sync.sh` — it reports which color names are missing from one surface. Fix HEX values in **both** `Preambles/header.tex` and `Quarto/theme-template.scss` to match. See `Preambles/README.md` for the full contract.

## R / data analysis

### `here::here()` resolves to the wrong directory

`here` needs a project root marker (`.here`, `.git`, `DESCRIPTION`, or `.Rproj`). If you see wrong paths, create an empty `.here` file at the repo root.

### `sessionInfo.txt` not updated after analysis changes

You ran `03_analyze.R` directly instead of `00_run_all.R`. Re-run `00_run_all.R` (e.g. via the `/data-analysis` skill or your usual pipeline runner) — that entrypoint writes the session snapshot as its last step.

## Permissions / bypass / statusline (v1.6.0)

### "Prompts fire despite `bypassPermissions`"

Mid-session permission-mode toggles override file settings until session end. The 6-tier stack (VSCode user → VSCode workspace → CLI user `~/.claude/settings.json` → project `.claude/settings.json` → project-local `.claude/settings.local.json` → in-session runtime) is **last-wins**. Run `/permission-check` — it diffs every layer and reports which wins. Then either exit and restart the session, or `/permission-mode bypassPermissions` to set it for the current session.

### `/permission-check` asks before reading `~/.claude/`

That's intentional. Host-global config can contain unrelated paths and secrets. Phase A (repo-local) is automatic; Phase B (host-global, with key redaction) requires explicit confirmation. See [CHANGELOG v1.6.0 — privacy boundary](CHANGELOG.md) for context.

### Statusline shows `[UNKNOWN]` or blank

Session JSON parse failure. Check `.claude/scripts/statusline.sh` is executable (`chmod +x`) and that `python3` is on `PATH`. Fallback output is `[?] <model> @ <pwd>` — if you see that, the hook caught a malformed session file. Restart Claude Code.

## Peer-review pipeline (v1.5.0)

### `/review-paper --peer AER` fails with "journal not found"

The target must be in [`.claude/references/journal-profiles.md`](.claude/references/journal-profiles.md). Ships with AER / QJE / JPE / ECMA / ReStud. To add your field's journal, copy [`templates/journal-profile-template.md`](templates/journal-profile-template.md) into `journal-profiles.md` and fill in the 7 schema sections (focus, bar, domain adjustments, methods adjustments, typical concerns, referee-pool weights, optional table format).

### Referees return near-identical reports

They weren't dispositioned. The editor agent should select **two different** dispositions from the 6-way taxonomy (STRUCTURAL / CREDIBILITY / MEASUREMENT / POLICY / THEORY / SKEPTIC). If reports are clones, the editor collapsed selection — usually because the paper is narrow enough that only one taxonomy applies. Try `--peer <journal> --stress` to force adversarial disposition pairing.

### R&R follow-up loses prior round context

Use `--r2` / `--r3` to continue a prior review. The editor agent reloads the previous `quality_reports/peer_review_*/decision.md` and classifies each revision (addressed / partially / deferred / disagreement). If the prior decision file is missing or renamed, the chain breaks — start fresh with `--peer`.

## Surface-sync gate (v1.6.0)

### `/commit` fails at Step 0b with "count drift detected"

`scripts/check-surface-sync.sh` detected a count mismatch (skills / agents / rules / hooks) across docs. The script reports which surface has the stale number. Fix every surface the script flags, then re-run. **Do not bypass** — the gate exists because manual `replace_all` has missed sibling phrasings three times (PRs #70/#76/#78 in v1.5.x).

### Adding a new skill / agent / rule breaks the gate

Expected. The gate counts `.claude/skills/` on disk vs prose assertions. After adding a skill, update the counts in README.md, CLAUDE.md (if mentioned), `guide/workflow-guide.qmd`, `docs/index.html` og:description, and `templates/skill-template.md`. The script tells you which are stale.

## Pre-Flight Reports (v1.6.0)

### Skill halts at "Pre-Flight Report failed — inputs not readable"

The skill couldn't read one of its required inputs (dataset, journal profile, notation registry, `r-code-conventions.md`, etc.). Check the file path in the error, confirm permissions, and confirm that fresh forks have the expected file (e.g., `/create-lecture` has a fresh-fork fallback for the notation registry; other skills do not). Do NOT edit the skill to skip Pre-Flight — the point is to catch hallucinated variable names and missing conventions before real work starts.

### Pre-Flight passes but the agent hallucinates anyway

Open an issue with the Pre-Flight Report attached. Either the input schema was incomplete, or the agent ignored the report. Both are bugs worth filing.

## Decision records (v1.6.0)

### Where do I save an ADR?

`quality_reports/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD_short-description.md` using [`templates/decision-record.md`](templates/decision-record.md). The directory is gitignored like `plans/` and `specs/` — commit only if you want the record visible to others. (Most forkers keep decisions local.)
